/* What is the Quick Sort?
 * --> In most situations, quick sort is the fastest sorting algorithm
 * --> The quick sort works by partitioning arrays so that the smaller numbers are on the 
 *     left and the larger are on the right - this is known as partitioning
 * --> It then recursively sends small parts of larger arrays to itself and partitions again, 
 *     until the whole array is in order / sorted
 * --> In partitioning, you will have to define a pivot value. Then you will have to switch everything 
 *     on the left side of the array that is larger than your pivot value with a value that is smaller than the pivot value. 
 *     This continues until everything is shifted from the left side of the array to the right side of the array
