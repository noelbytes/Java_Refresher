/*The Shell Sort partially sorts the array by sorting elements that are a certain 
 * number of spaces apart called the interval
 * The index to the left will be referred to as the inner index, and h -  will be representing the interval, 
 * or number of spaces apart, and this is also known as the outer part of the array when using the shell sort. 
 * The performance of the shell sort algorithm improves when compared to the insertion sort algorithm, 
 * since we eliminate the need to shift many indexes in the array. */
