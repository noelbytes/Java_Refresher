/* What is a recursive method?
 * --> A method that calls itself
 * --> With each method call, the problem becomes simpler
 * --> Must have a condition that leads to the method no longer making another method call on itself
 * 
 * E.g. To method get a triangular number
 * public int getTriangularNumber(int number) {
 * 		if (number == 1) {
 * 			return 1;
 * 		} else {
 * 			return (number + getTraingularNumber(number - 1));
 * }
} */
