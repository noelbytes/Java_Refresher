	/*
	 * Sorts in the past have normally, always been at the very least of the order
	 * of N, i.e. O(N), and the reason why is because to properly sort a list of
	 * elements in an array, we have to look at every single element in the array at
	 * least one time, so that's the absolute minimum.
	 * 
	 * However, what we want to try to avoid is something inefficient like O(N^2),
	 * which is what we had with the bubble sort.
	 * 
	 * We already know that the quick sort is efficient, but the main answer is
	 * going to be, why is it so efficient?
	 * 
	 * To figure out the number of comparisons that we need to make with the quick
	 * sort, we first need to remember that it is comparing and moving values very
	 * efficiently without shifting, unlike the other sorting algorithms that we've
	 * used in the past, and that means that values are only going to be compared
	 * once. They're not going to be compared to each other over and over again. So
	 * in essence, each comparison will reduce the possible final sorted list in
	 * half.
	 * 
	 * In other words: 
	 * --------------------- 
	 * Number of comparisons = logN! or
	 * Comparisons = logN + log(N - 1) + ........ + log(1) 
	 * If we actually look at this, and sort it down, in actuality, we can also see that comparisons is
	 * also going to be equal to - NlogN Comparisons = NlogN
	 * 
	 * Quick Sort in a Nutshell: 
	 * Pick a Pivot: Choose one element from the array (e.g., the last element). 
	 * Partition: Rearrange the array so that: 
	 * Elements smaller than the pivot go to its left. Elements larger go to its right.
	 * Repeat: Recursively apply this to the left and right parts. 
	 * 
	 * Why ùëÇ ( ùëÅ log ‚Å°ùëÅ )? 
	 * Partitioning Takes ùëÇ ( ùëÅ ):
	 * Each partition step goes through the array once to rearrange elements. 
	 * 
	 * Divide and Conquer Takes log ‚Å°ùëÅ:
	 * After each partition, the array is split into two smaller subarrays. The
	 * splitting continues until the subarrays are very small (usually 1 element).
	 * 
	 * Combine These Steps:
	 * Since you do O(N) work (partitioning) logN times (splitting), the total time is O(NlogN). 
	 * 
	 * Quick Example: 
	 * For an array with 8 elements:
	 * First split: 8 elements ‚Üí ùëÇ ( 8 ). 
	 * Second split: Two subarrays with 4 elements each ‚Üí ùëÇ ( 4 + 4 ). 
	 * Third split: Four subarrays with 2 elements each ‚Üí ùëÇ ( 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 ). 
	 * Total: ùëÇ ( 8 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 ) O(8+4+4+2+2+2+2), which simplifies to O(8‚ãÖlog8). (i.e. log(base2)8)
	 * 
	 * Why is Quick Sort Fast? 
	 * 
	 * Balanced Splits: When the pivot splits the array into two roughly equal parts, it achieves ùëÇ (ùëÅ log ùëÅ).
	 * 
	 * If splits are unbalanced (e.g., always one element on one side), it could
	 * degrade to ùëÇ ( ùëÅ^2 ). But this is rare with good pivot selection.
